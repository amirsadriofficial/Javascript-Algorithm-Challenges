Given a positive integer millis, write an asynchronous function that sleeps for millis milliseconds. It can resolve any value.

 

Example 1:<br>
Input: millis = 100<br>
Output: 100<br>
Explanation: It should return a promise that resolves after 100ms.<br>

Example 2:<br>
Input: millis = 200<br>
Output: 200<br>
Explanation: It should return a promise that resolves after 200ms.<br>
 

Constraints:<br>
1 <= millis <= 1000
